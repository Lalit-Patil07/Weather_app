# React Weather App (OpenWeather)

Minimal pure-React app that fetches current weather for a city using the OpenWeather API and displays details in a table.

Setup
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` with your OpenWeather API key.
- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Usage
- Enter a city name (e.g. "London") and click Search. The app shows weather details (temperature, humidity, wind, sunrise/sunset, etc.) in a table.

Notes
- The project expects a Create React App environment. If you prefer Vite or another bundler, adapt the scripts in `package.json`.
